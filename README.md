## Don't care for all the bells and whistles?

If you don't care for all the features and complexity of this extension but still dislike the media controls being in the notification area, you may like this extension's sister extension, [gnome-shell-extensions-mpris-indicator-button](https://github.com/JasonLG1979/gnome-shell-extensions-mpris-indicator-button/)
